# Cruel Kernel Tree for G973F (Samsung S10)

![CI](https://github.com/CruelKernel/exynos9820-beyond1lte/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Based on samsung sources and android common tree.

## How to install

This kernel works on BSKO && BSL4 firmware.
First of all, TWRP Recovery + multidisabler should be installed in all cases.
It's a preliminary step.

### TWRP

Reboot to TWRP Recovery. Flash boot.img in boot slot.

### Heimdall

Reboot to Download Mode.
```bash
$ sudo heimdall flash --BOOT boot.img
```

### Odin

Steps:
- Pack boot.img to AP.zip
- Reboot to Download Mode.
- Flash AP.zip in AP slot.

### Franco Kernel Manager

Flash boot.img with FK Manager.

## How to customize the kernel

It's possible to customize the kernel and build it from the browser.
First of all, create and account on GitHub. Next, **fork** this repository.
At this step you've got your copy of the sources and you can build it with
GitHub Actions. You need to open github actions [configuration file](.github/workflows/main.yml)
and **edit** it from the browser. For example, to alter the kernel configuration
you need to edit lines:
```YAML
    - name: Kernel Configure
      run: |
        ./build config name=cruel \
                +magisk           \
                +ttl              \
                +wireguard
```

You can change the name of the kernel by replacing ```name=cruel``` with, for example,
```name=my_own_kernel```. You can remove wireguard from the kernel if you don't need it
by changing "+" to "-" or by removing the "+wireguard" line and "\\" on the previous line.

Available configuration presets can be found at [configs](kernel/configs/) folder.
Only the *.conf files prefixed with "cruel" are valuable.
For example:
* magisk - integrates magisk into the kernel. This allows to have root without
  booting from recovery. Enabled by default.
* magisk+canary - integrates canary magisk into the kernel.
* ttl - adds iptables filters for altering ttl values of network packets. This
  helps to bypass tethering blocking in mobile networks.
* wireguard - adds wireguard module to the kernel.
* insecure - removes kernel protection mechanisms. Potentially, can increase
  the kernel performance. Don't use it if you don't know what you are doing.
* 300hz - increases kernel clock rate from 250hz to 300hz. Potentially, can
  increate response time. Disabled by default, untested.
* 1000hz - increases kernel clock rate from 250hz to 1000hz. Potentially, can
  increate response time. Disabled by default, untested.

After editing the configuration in the browser, save it and **commit**.
Next, you need to **switch** to the "Actions" tab. At this step you will find that
GitHub starts to build the kernel. You need to **wait** about 25-30 mins while the github build
the kernel. If the build is successfully finished, you will find your boot.img in the Artifacts
section.
